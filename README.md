# Demiurge
Demiurge is a god game with minimal graphic design and straightforward gameplay. The game revolves around the entities living in a randomly generated game world - most interesting of which are the Humans.

The project is incomplete, but functional. I began creating Demiurge as part of my A-Level coursework in 2017, and as such it showcases algorithms such as A* pathfinding, flocking, voronoi map generation, and decision trees.
